# Carbon Credit Tokens

## Overview
Carbon Credit Tokens is a blockchain-based solution aimed at facilitating the trading and tracking of carbon credits. By utilizing smart contracts, this project ensures secure, transparent, and verifiable transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. This project leverages Solidity for contract development and JavaScript for interactions with the blockchain.

## Features
- **Smart Contracts**: Secure token minting, transferring, and carbon credit management using Solidity.
- **Decentralized Platform**: Operates on the Ethereum blockchain for transparent and tamper-proof transactions.
- **Modular Architecture**: Easily extendable with additional features like carbon credit auditing or multi-token standards.

## Repository Structure
- `/contracts`: Contains the Solidity smart contracts responsible for minting and managing carbon credit tokens.
- `/migrations`: Handles the deployment process of the smart contracts to the blockchain.
- `/test`: Includes JavaScript test scripts using the Truffle framework to verify contract functionality.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ali-3-3-3/Carbon-Credit-Tokens.git
   ```
   
2. **Install dependencies**:
   Navigate to the project directory and install required packages:
   ```bash
   cd Carbon-Credit-Tokens
   npm install
   ```

3. **Deploy the contracts**:
   Ensure you have a local Ethereum node running (like Ganache) and deploy the contracts:
   ```bash
   truffle migrate
   ```

## Usage
Once the contracts are deployed, interact with them using JavaScript in a Node.js environment. You can mint, transfer, or check balances of carbon credit tokens.

## Testing
Run the provided test scripts to ensure the functionality of the contracts:
```bash
truffle test
```
